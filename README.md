# iMessage Prototype

An example project demonstrating how the Figma MCP server can accelerate rapid prototyping by generating React Native code directly from Figma designs.

## About This Project

This iMessage prototype was generated using the Figma MCP server to showcase how AI-powered design-to-code workflows can streamline the development process. The design was extracted from a [Figma iMessage Chat Builder](https://www.figma.com/design/bjsrkCxgA1ZLhORXF2fo2g/iMessage-Chat-Builder?node-id=3498-3849&t=zvN9VO7oCn1Fygwt-4) and converted into a functional React Native app.

## Key Features

- **Authentic iMessage Design**: Replicates the visual design and layout of iMessage
- **Message Bubbles**: Blue bubbles for sender messages, gray for recipient messages
- **Message Reactions**: Support for heart, thumbs up, haha, and double exclamation reactions
- **Input Bar**: Functional text input with send button that activates when typing
- **Navigation Bar**: Contact info with profile picture and back button
- **Native iOS Integration**: Uses native iOS status bar and system elements

## Technology Stack

- **React Native** with Expo
- **TypeScript** for type safety
- **Figma MCP Server** for design-to-code generation
- **iOS-optimized** for authentic mobile experience

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v14 or higher)

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone <repository-url>
cd chat-app

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start the development server
npm start

# Run on iOS
npm run ios
```

## Rapid Prototyping Workflow

This project demonstrates the power of AI-assisted design-to-code workflows:

1. **Design in Figma**: Create detailed UI designs with proper components and styling
2. **MCP Server Integration**: Use Figma MCP server to extract design tokens, components, and layout
3. **Code Generation**: Generate React Native components with proper styling and behavior
4. **Iterative Refinement**: Quickly iterate on the generated code to match design requirements

## Benefits of Figma MCP Server

- **Faster Prototyping**: Convert designs to code in minutes instead of hours
- **Design Consistency**: Maintain visual fidelity between design and implementation
- **Reduced Development Time**: Focus on functionality rather than recreating designs
- **Better Collaboration**: Designers and developers can work more closely together

## Future Enhancements

- Message threading and replies
- Media sharing (photos, videos)
- Push notifications
- Real-time messaging
- Dark mode support
